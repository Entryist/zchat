## Minimum viable Nostr client

![Nostr client](https://github.com/Entryist/zchat/blob/main/public/mvn.png)

#### Features:

- Create account via Schnorr keypair
- Connect to a Nostr relay
- See posts from two initial users we have hardcoded subscriptions to
- Create posts that send to the relay - you'll see them since you're subscribed to your own updaes
- Add a pubkey of anyone else and you'll see their updates (stored in browser, cleared on logout). You can test this yourself using two browser windows
